Project 1 Movie Search Engine 


## Team Popcorn Tagger


 Our movie search engine is for everyone who wants to search movies from a genre, get movie ratings and descriptions of the movie.
Our project fullfills all requirements.


We use Materialize.com as a CSS framework.

We have deployed to GitHub Pages.

We’re interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

We’re using at least two server-side APIs.

We have not used alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

We use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Have a polished UI.

We have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Technologies Used

* Materialize

* Javascript

* Style.CS

* HTML
